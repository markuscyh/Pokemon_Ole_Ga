This is a program meant to simulate a Pokemon double battle. The program has three separate phases. 

  1) The Pokemon Selection Phase
  2) The Battle Phase
  3) The Post-Battle Phase

Below is a rough tutorial/explanation of how to play the game

Phase 1: Pokemon Selection
In this phase, the program will randomly generate 3 pokemon from a established list of pokemon
Every pokemon in the game is assinged a grade. This grade signifies the rarity and intended strength of the Pokemon, with grade 1 being the most common, but the weakest, and grade 6 being the most rare, but the strongest.
The user is told to select a Pokemon to become their first Pokemon. However, the other 2 Pokemon ignored will become the enemy Pokemon that the user has to fight.
After this initial selection, the user will be given another choice between two other Pokemon to become their second Pokemon. The Pokemon that wasn't selected will be removed from the game and will not become part of the enemy team.
After this phase is done, the battle phase will begin.

Phase 2: Battle
